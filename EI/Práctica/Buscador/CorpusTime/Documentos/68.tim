WARNED THAT AFRICA AND ASIA ARE IMPERILED BY A " SECOND SCRAMBLE " OF

COLONIZATION, LED THIS TIME BY COMMUNIST POWERS, " WHO ARE COMMITTING

THE SAME CRIME AS THE CAPITALISTS BEFORE . " SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE

HEAD OF THE INDIAN DELEGATION DENOUNCED THE ORGANIZATION AS A " FRAUD,

CARRIED THEIR OWN SQUABBLE INTO AFRICA . THERE WERE WIDESPREAD

SUSPICIONS THAT THE CHINESE WERE TO BLAME WHEN THE AMPLIFIER FOR THE

RUSSIAN TRANSLATION HOOKUP DISAPPEARED, WAS LATER FOUND IN A DITCH

OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE HALL . TIT FOLLOWED TAT . NEXT DAY THE CHINESE
