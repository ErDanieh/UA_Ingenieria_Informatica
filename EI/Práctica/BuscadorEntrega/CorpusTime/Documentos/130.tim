FROM THE SECOND CITY MOST RUSSIAN INTELLECTUALS LISTENED IN

TIGHT-LIPPED SILENCE AS WORD OF NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S LATEST CULTURAL

CRACKDOWN (TIME, MARCH 22) FILTERED OUT TO THE PROVINCES . NOT SO THE

WRITERS AND ARTISTS OF LENINGRAD, RUSSIA'S SECOND CITY . WHEN THE LOCAL

COMMISSARS MET TO GIVE THEM THE WORD, THE INTELLECTUALS TALKED RIGHT

BACK . THE LENINGRAD EDITION OF PRAVDA REPORTED ACIDLY LAST WEEK THAT

UNDER ATTACK, BUT " DID NOT GIVE A CORRECT EVALUATION OF CRITICISM

DIRECTED AT HIMSELF . " THAT WASN'T ALL . " THINGS EVEN CAME TO SUCH A

PASS, " SAID THE NEWSPAPER, " THAT SOME BEGAN TO FEEL " SHY' ABOUT

SPEAKING ON SOCIALIST REALISM . " SHYEST OF ALL INTELLECTUALS IN THE

SOVIET UNION WAS POET EVGENY EVTUSHENKO, USUALLY THE MOST OUTSPOKEN OF

THE LOT . EVTUSHENKO HAD BEEN SINGLED OUT BY KHRUSHCHEV FOR A SCATHING
