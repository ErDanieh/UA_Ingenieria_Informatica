# Build
This project is built using CMake and Make and requires the MNIST dataset to work. There is a shell script included that performs all operations required. Just execute the script as follow:

chmod a+x ./get_dataset.sh
./get_dataset.sh

The script will create a build folder, download the MNIST dataset and create the makefile using CMake. Once executed, just use make to build the executable.
